                    On a study day, the day usually starts quite early - around 7:00 in the morning. I usually start the day with breakfast, which consists of oatmeal with variable toppings and a cup of coffee.
                    If there is no early morning lecture on the given day, then before leaving for the University of Latvia I go to work or more often than not I work from home as a .Net programmer.

                     <li>It is a good aerobic activity</li>
                     <li>There is no free parking at the university</li>

                                    The National Library of Latvia, or the Castle of Light, is a modern and creative world-class information and cultural center located on the Daugava embankment.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The National Library of Latvia, also known as "Castle of Light" or in Latvian "Gaismas pils" is home to a huge amount of books and other sources of information. It is also a community center where people go to learn and participate in various cultural events.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In 2017, in the culture and architecture section of the BBC, LNB's new building was ranked among the 10 largest, most beautiful and most modern libraries in the world of the 21st century.
                                    <br><br>
                                    However, in contrast to the impressive pace of building construction at the University of Latvia, the construction of the "Light Palace" did not go so smoothly. Construction began in 2008 and the building of the Latvian National Library opened its doors to readers in 2014.

                                    <br>
                                    After the Zemgale bridge was destroyed in 1944, in 1955, as the second street traffic bridge in Riga, a stone bridge over the Daugava began to be built. The axis of the former bridge was chosen for the place where the bridge will be built, along which the traffic between the two banks of the Daugava had been stabilized for a long time. The bridge was opened in 1957 under the name October Bridge and in 1992 it was renamed the Stone Bridge. It is interesting that initially the part of the bridge near the right bank was liftable for the passage of larger ships.

                                    <b>Parameters of the bridge</b>
                                    The bridge is 503.12 meters long and 27.5 meters wide.

                                    Of course we need to also mention Daugava, which is Latvias's largest river and an integral part of Riga. Of course, Daugava is also one of the national symbols in Latvian culture. Its total length is 1005 kilometers and 352 kilometers in the territory of Latvia.

                                    This gracious house, located on the Town Hall Square, is full of stories that stretch until the 14th century.Inside, the house reveals a wide collection that demonstrates its former inhabitants, history and lifestyle.
                                    The oldest articles on this house are even from the year 1334, when the Riga was taken by Livonian order.
                                    The House of Blackheads also plays a crucial role in Latvian cultural life. Not only is it serving as a museum and tourist destination, but it is also a place for cultural events such as concerts and exhibitions.

                                    The House of Black Heads is a sample of Gothic style with Renaissance elements overlapping with the stylistic features of the later age, as the house has been restored several times, but it has also managed to keep some parts of the building from the 15th century.

                                    The history of the Freedom Monument is closely linked to the history of Latvia. The idea came in the light in 1922, when the then Latvian Prime Minister Zigfrīds Anna Meierovics instructed to develop rules for the competition for the construction of the "Piemiņas stabs".
                                    On November 18th, 1935. Freedom Monument was opened. It was built from public donations.

                                    After the Second World War, during the Soviet occupation, there were plans to demolish the monument and they were repeated several times in the course of history, but luckily it was not demolished.

                                    It is interesting that if you slow down a little and step away from the daily rush and look at what is on my way to the University of Latvia, you can see so many buildings that are important to Latvian culture and rich in history, such as the Freedom Monument, the House of Black Heads and also the National Library of Latvia.

                                        The building of the University of Latvia itself is also not insignificant and has a long history.
                                        It was built in 1862 for the needs of Riga Polytechnic institute according to the project of G.F.A Hilberg.
                                        In 1919, Latvijas augstskola was opened here, and since 1922 its name has been the University of Latvia.

                                    <b>Studies</b>
                                    Currently, the building at Raina bulvāri 19 is home to only two faculties: the Faculty of Computing and the Faculty of Law.

                                    It might seem that as a 3rd year student at the Faculty of Computer Science, I should know the corridors of the University very well. However, this is not the case, I definitely don't know the cabinet numbers by heart! This is so, because the first two years of study were mainly conducted remotely due to the Covid-19 virus.
