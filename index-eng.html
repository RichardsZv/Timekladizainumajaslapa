                    On a study day, the day usually starts quite early - around 7:00 in the morning. I usually start the day with breakfast, which consists of oatmeal with variable toppings and a cup of coffee.
                    If there is no early morning lecture on the given day, then before leaving for the University of Latvia I go to work or more often than not I work from home as a .Net programmer.

                    I try to go to the University by bicycle as much as possible, regardless of the season or the weather. <br>
                    I choose a bicycle as the main means of transportation for several reasons:

                     <li>It is by far the fastest way of moving around Riga</li>
                     <li>I'm not a fan of public transport</li>
                     <li>It is a good aerobic activity</li>
                     <li>There is no free parking at the university</li>
                     <li>It is an environmentally friendly way of transportation</li>

                                    I must say! To me personally the project of the LU academic center seems really impressive. I definitely believe that this is a very good investment in the future and development of Latvia.
                                    It is also a pleasure to see that the work is progressing so quickly and that the 'Rakstu māja' is already being built. Every time I go on my way to the University of Latvia, I see that the construction works have already progressed a little bit from the last time.
                                    If they will manage to implement all the projects in the planned time, then really hats off, especially considering that construction in Riga is usually very slow.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's a pity that, as far as I understand, the Faculty of Computing will not be moving
                                    away from Raiņa bulvāris to the new academic center, so I will be no extra motivation to study for a master's degree after a while.

                                    Despite the truly grandiose project in which a lot of millions were spent, the surrounding infrastructure is, in my opinion, simply TERRIBLE!
                                    Crossroads on all sides and crossings are made in such a way that the cars are always in front and you can't even see if pedestrians and cyclists have the green light.
                                    Not even talking about getting on the stone bridge at all. A whole strategy is needed there, which had to be practiced during many trips to the University of Latvia.

                                    I already mentioned in the previous section that getting on the stone bridge is difficult - it really is.

                                    Several crossings have to be crossed and then I need to drive under the bridge on a narrow sidewalk, where if someone drives towards you, as our Prime Minister would say - "Draugi, nav labi!"

                                    In general, I believe that patience is my strong suit, but when crossing the 503-meter-long Akmens bridge, I almost always think - I need to remember to buy a bicycle bell. There usually are a lot of people crossing the bridge and it is hard to interchange.. and then there are those bolt scooters... no comments!

                                    When driving off the stone bridge, it doesn't hurt to pray, because you have to cross, in my opinion, one of the most dangerous pedestrian crossings in Riga, where drivers tend to not brake.

                                    I must say that nowhere else in Riga do you see so many tourists as right next to the House of the Black Heads.
                                    Always in groups and always taking photos. I usually try to be polite and not ruin the pictures, but I wouldn't be surprised if I saw myself in the background of a tourist picture on Instagram.
                                    Although the main audience of this tourist object is usually not young people, but older Western Europeans, so there is no need to worry about it.

                                    It was quite difficult to take photographs here even for this website, as people gathered in large numbers in the middle of the day. Especially on this day, when the World Hockey Championship is taking place in Riga and the influx of tourists is substantial.

                                    To be honest, I have not been inside this house myself, but I only know that it is quite old and the history is full of stories. I haven't delved into it, so I won't be able to tell you more.

                                    The destination is already very close, just one last object before the University of Latvia.
                                    When riding past the Freedom Monument, it is worth reminding yourself that you live in a free country. Especially now, when the war is going on in Ukraine.

                                    In general, this road to Raina bulvāri 19 usually takes me about 20 to 25 minutes by bicycle. I must say that sometimes it is a problem to find a place to park a bicycle, because the University seems to have unfortunately not taken care of a bicycle storage facility available to students.

                                    It is interesting that if you slow down a little and step away from the daily rush and look at what is on my way to the University of Latvia, you can see so many buildings that are important to Latvian culture and rich in history, such as the Freedom Monument, the House of Black Heads and also the National Library of Latvia.

                                    It might seem that as a 3rd year student at the Faculty of Computer Science, I should know the corridors of the University very well. However, this is not the case, I definitely don't know the cabinet numbers by heart! This is so, because the first two years of study were mainly conducted remotely due to the Covid-19 virus.
